There are 3 columns, for fitting blocks of data containing 3 values each, and 8 rows, to correspond to the 8 blocks of data of that size that are possible in the original 1-D array. We can then use the `strides` argument to control how NumPy walks between items in each dimension. The last item in the strides tuple simply states that the number of bytes to walk between items is just the size of an item. (Increasing this last item would skip items.) The first item says that when we go to a new element (in this example, a new row), only advance the size of a single item. This is what gives us overlapping rows.
