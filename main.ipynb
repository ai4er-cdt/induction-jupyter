Blind people use screen reading software to read the contents of the screen, accompanied by a braille display that shows a single line of text in braille. Most common braille displays have 40 cells, meaning they are able to show 40 characters at once. There are also braille displays that have double that size.\n",
    "Now usually, a tab takes only one cell on a braille display, whereas four spaces take four cells. In other words, having a block of indentation that has 20 spaces in front of the code means that half of the common braille display is swallowed up by spacing, compared to only five cells when using tabs."
